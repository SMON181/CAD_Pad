# CAD_Pad
My Hack Pad for hack club - made for CAD

This keyboard will have the keys that I most use when I am cadding stuff for my robotics team.
This was a really big learning experience for me - I learned how to use fusion (I normally use onshape), make a PCB, and use github.

Made using Fusion, and Kicad.
